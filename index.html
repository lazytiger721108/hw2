          As a UI/UX designer, it's very important to gain the skills necessary to analyze and identify flaws in an
          existing interface, create lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes for various screen sizes, and build a responsive website
          based on those prototypes.

          I chose to redesign an online bookstore website: https://www.powells.com/. The reason I chose this site is
          that the UI looks relatively old-fashioned and some designs on the webpage are not reasonable enough and cause
          inconvenience for users.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Finding" class="caption2">Finding Problems</h2>
        <p>
          This project started with the problem of old-fashioned and unreasonable user interface. To practice the skills
          of identifying flaws of an existing interface, I mainly focused on 3 different perspectives: usability,
          memorability and learnability.

          Regarding WAVE's accessibility assessment, I disagree with the "error" part. Since the word "search" is not
          displayed on the search button, but only a magnifying glass icon is displayed, WAVE believes that this button
          is empty or has no value text, and cannot indicate the function of this button. But in fact, the "magnifying
          glass" icon often represents the meaning of "search" in our daily life. So I think this part shouldn't
          regarded as an real "error".

      <h1 class="caption">Part 2: Visual Design Iterations</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          After identifying flaws in the original interface, I worked on designing the lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes.
          During this process, I mainly focused on the interaction perspective, which is one of the cores of UI/UX
          design.
        </p>
        <p>Specifically, considering the rule of match between system and real world, it's critical to make sure that
          the new design matches real-world users' expectations. To achieve this goal, I gained some inspiration from
          some existing websites/apps, such as Google and Amazon.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I simplified the navigation bar (only keep the most important features), expand the size of the search
          bar (like Google’s homepage) and book images, and reduce the white space on the left and right sides of the
          original web page, which makes it easier for users to find the features they want, and users can focus on the
          book itself.

        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, I added a shopping cart and a heart icon next to the book image, which allows users to add their
          favorite books to the cart/wishlist directly on the homepage. And the rating and price of the book are
          displayed next to the book image, and users do not need to click on the book details page to learn about
          these. This design is very close to Amazon’s mobile app.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the specific design prototypes, screen size and device/platform are two very important factors.
          Therefore, we were asked to design a responsive design, that is, a suitable layout for mobile, tablet, and
          desktop. First, I designed the lo-fi wireframes with Balsamiq. Then, based on lo-fi wireframes, I used Figma
          to get my design closer to the finished product.

      <h2>Annotations</h2>
      <h3>Layout Choice</h3>
      <p>Flexbox can quickly achieve proportional distribution. When the page needs to adapt to different screen sizes
        and/or device types, we need to make sure that the elements/components have the appropriate “behavior” in
        layout, Flexbox is the best choice.
      </p>

      <h3>Different Size</h3>
      <p>The webpage will automatically adjust the page layout according to the size of the browser window.
      </p>
      <p>PC side: Due to the wide computer screen, each grid (book product) is placed horizontally.
      </p>
      <p>Mobile/Tablet side: Since the screen of the mobile phone/tablet is long and narrow, each grid (book product) is
        placed vertically.
      </p>

      <h3>Page Change</h3>
      <p>The user clicks the heart icon, which represents the "add to wishlist" feature, and the heart will turn from
        white to red; when the user clicks again, the heart icon will change from red to white.
      </p>
      <p>When the user clicks on the picture/text of the book product, a corresponding pop-up window will appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I implemented my responsive webpage using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

      <p>
        In this project, I first learned about the basic design process, including creating lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes,
        and used the knowledge and perspectives learned in the class to identify some flaws in the existing design. As
        for implementation, I had some experience in web development before, so this assignment is also a good
        opportunity for me to review web dev knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        For my redesign, most reviewers think it is much more elegant and clean than the original webpage, and my study
        is also very in-depth. But some reviewers also left some suggestions on the image size in my redesign.
      </p>
      <p>
        A very important lesson is that when building prototypes, I should add sufficient annotations, which makes my
        prototypes more comprehensive.

      </p>
      <p>
        Next, if I have time, I will adjust the color of my website, and use some CSS library, such as Bootstrap or Ant
        Design, to make the style of the entire page more consistent.
